Whereas in the first Year of the Reign
of our late Sovereign King <em>James</em>
of happy memory, an Act was
made for the charitable relief and
ordering of Persons infected with
the Plague: whereby Authority
was given to Justices of Peace,
Majors, Bayliffs, and other Head-Officers
to appoint within their several Limits Examiners,
Searchers, Watchmen, Keepers, and Buriers for the
Persons and Places infected, and to minister unto them
Oaths for the performance of their Offices. And the
same Statute did also authorize the giving of other Directions,
as unto them for the present necessity should
seem good in their discretions. It is now upon special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>consideration thought very expedient for preventing
and avoiding of infection of Sickness (if it shall so please
Almighty God) that these Officers following be appointed,
and these Orders hereafter duly observed.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><i>Examiners to be appointed in every Parish.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>First, it is thought requisite and so ordered, that in
every Parish there be one, two, or more persons of
good sort and credit, chosen and appointed by the Alderman,
his Deputy, and Common-Councel of every
Ward, by the name of Examiners, to continue in that
Office the space of two Moneths at least: And if any
fit Person so appointed, shall refuse to undertake the
same, the said parties so refusing, to be committed to
Prison until they shall conform themselves accordingly.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><i>The Examiners Office.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>That these Examiners be sworn by the Alderman, to
enquire and learn from time to time what Houses in
every Parish be visited, and what persons be sick, and of
what Diseases, as near as they can inform themselves;
and upon doubt in that case, to command restraint of access,
until it appear what the Disease shall prove: And
if they finde any person sick of the Infection, to give
order to the Constable that the House be shut up; and
if the Constable shall be found remiss or negligent, to
give present notice thereof to the Alderman of the
Ward.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><i>Watchmen.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>That to every Infected House there be appointed
two Watchmen, one for the Day, and the other for
the Night: And that these Watchmen have a special
care that no person goe in or out of such infected Houses,
whereof they have the Charge, upon pain of severe punishment.
And the said Watchmen to doe such further
Offices as the sick House shall need and require: And
if the Watchman be sent upon any business, to lock up
the House and take the Key with him: and the Watchman
by day to attend until ten of the clock at night:
and the Watchman by night until six in the morning.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><i>Searchers.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>That there be a special care, to appoint Women-Searchers
in every Parish, such as are of honest reputation,
and of the best sort as can be got in this kind:
And these to be sworn to make due search and true report,
to the utmost of their knowledge, whether the
Persons, whose bodies they are appointed to Search, do
die of the Infection, or of what other Diseases, as near
as they can. And that the Physicians who shall be appointed
for cure and prevention of the Infection, do
call before them the said Searchers who are or shall be
appointed for the several Parishes under their respective
Cares, to the end they may consider whether they are
fitly qualified for that employment; and charge them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>from time to time as they shall see cause, if they appear
defective in their duties.</p>

<p class='c006'>That no Searcher during this time of Visitation, be
permitted to use any publick work or imployment, or
keep any Shop or Stall, or be imployed as a Landress,
or in any other common imployment whatsoever.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><i>Chirurgions.</i></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>For better assistance of the Searchers, for as much
as there hath been heretofore great abuse in misreporting
the Disease, to the further spreading of the
Infection: It is therefore ordered, that there be chosen
and appointed able and discreet Chirurgions, besides
those that doe already belong to the Pest-house:
amongst whom, the City and Liberties to be quartered
as the places lie most apt and convenient: and every
of these to have one quarter for his Limit: and the said
Chirurgions in every of their Limits to joyn with the
Searchers for the view of the body, to the end there may
be a true report made of the Disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>And further, that the said Chirurgions shall visit and
search such like persons as shall either send for them, or
be named and directed unto them, by the examiners of
every Parish, and inform themselves of the Disease of
the said parties.</p>

<p class='c006'>And for as much as the said Chirurgions are to be sequestred
from all other Cures, and kept onely to this
Disease of the Infection; It is ordered, that every of the
said Chirurgions shall have twelve-pence a Body searched
by them, to be paid out of the goods of the party searched,
if he be able, or otherwise by the Parish.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>
  <h3 class='c004'><i>Nurse-keepers.</i></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c005'>If any Nurse-keeper shall remove herself out of any
infected House before 28 daies after the decease of
any person dying of the Infection, the House to which
the said Nurse-keeper doth so remove herself shall be
shut up until the said 28 daies be expired.</p>

knowledge thereof to the Examiner of Health within
two hours after the said sign shall appear.</p>

<h3 class='c004'><i>Sequestration of the Sick.</i></h3>

die not, the House wherein he sickned shall be

Forasmuch as nothing is more complained of,

dispersing the Plague. And that no Company or person
be suffered to remain or come into any Tavern, Alehouse
